  Metadata format is :

  Download the entire content of a bucket or specified files

  You specify the list of objects with this format :

      ["object1.ext": nil, "object2.ext": "alternate.ext", ...]

  In this example, `object1.ext` will be saved with the same name, but `object2.ext` will be saved with the name `alternate.ext`

  If `output_path` is `nil`, objects will be saved in the current directory

  ## Example:

      Kuraudo.ObjectStore.download(driver, bucket, "/path/to/output", ["test.txt": "test.txt.save"])

  Delete files or bucket

  For file, you can pass :

  * `:all` : in this case, all files in the bucket are deleted, but not the bucket itself. 
  * an array of filename : in this case, only the files given in the array are deleted, but not the bucket itself, even if it is empty.
  * nothing or an empty array : in this case, the bucket is deleted. (default)
